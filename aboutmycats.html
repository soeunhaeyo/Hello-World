        <h2>Darkness: My favorite cat</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite cat is <strong>Darkness</strong>. She is a <em>black</em> cat
            and she loves to eat! The foods that she likes to eat in ranked order are:
            <ol>
                <li>Wet food</li>
                <li>Treats</li>
                <li>Kibble</li>

        <h2>Mimi: My fat cat</h2>
        <p>
            Mimi is a cat who's fat. I don't really know <em>why</em> she's fat. 
            She's pretty active, but she loves to eat her kibble. Here is a list of the 
            thing she likes to do:
            <ul>
                <li>Sleep</li>
                <li>Kibble</li>
                <li>Stare outside</li>
            </ul>
