        <h2>Mimi: My fat cat</h2>
        <p>
            Mimi is a cat who's fat. I don't really know <em>why</em> she's fat. 
            She's pretty active, but she loves to eat her kibble. Here is a list of the 
            thing she likes to do:
            <ul>
                <li>Sleep</li>
                <li>Kibble</li>
                <li>Stare outside</li>
            </ul>
